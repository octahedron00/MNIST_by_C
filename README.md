# MNIST_by_C

### A Neural Network solving MNIST only with C/C++.

#### Without any package, class, pre-written code.

These can be used for education of neural network, since C++ can be easily read.

The codes are written by Octo Moon : <octahedron00@gmail.com>

## How to use

You can download exe files to run program, or cpp files to read and edit.

To use programs, you should **download MNIST dataset from [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)**, and put them **in the same place** with exe file.

## 0_mnist_reader

A simple file reader.

You can select intervals to read.

This shows data in dataset by using ASCII-art.

## 1_mnist_NN

### 784 - 32 - 32 - 10

A simple neural network

This can get about 4.5% error rate in 10 epochs.
